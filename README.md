# Flood

Liquidity Provider bot for CL pools.

Flood creates and manages Concentrated Liquidity (CL) pool positions ensuring that capital deployed is done according to a useful set of rules.

The primary objective is to try to maintain two positions of quote and base assets that allows the owner of the bot to define the price(s) at which the quote and base are to be sold.
